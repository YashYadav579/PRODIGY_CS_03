# 🛡️ PRODIGY_CS_03 - Password Complexity Checker (GUI Version)

### ✅ Internship Task - Prodigy Infotech (Cyber Security Track)

This repository contains **Task 03** of the **Prodigy Infotech Cyber Security Internship**, where I developed a **Password Complexity Checker** using **Python** and **CustomTkinter**.  
The tool analyzes a password's strength based on multiple rules and gives both visual and textual feedback.

## 🔐 What is Password Complexity?

Password complexity refers to the **difficulty of guessing or cracking** a password. A strong password typically includes:
- ✅ Sufficient **length**
- ✅ **Uppercase & lowercase** letters
- ✅ **Digits**
- ✅ **Special characters**

The tool checks for all of these and classifies passwords into **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong** categories.
